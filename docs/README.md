# APPLE CALCULATOR 

This is my first mini-project using:
HTML
CSS
Vanilla JavaScript

I first began by coding along to a YouTube video from:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGgLHJGyS34&pp=0gcJCfwJAYcqIYzv 

Afterwards, I attempted to create my project from scratch but instead I decided to create mines similar to Apple's built-in Calulator App.

Granted, much of my debugging came from the use of resources such as ChatGPT. There are still some minor bugs to the logic, and calculator operations. 

As this is my first project with JavaScript, I will continue to work and gain proficency in building Front-End Responsive Pages and debugging with JavaScript, before moving onto building with React and other Front-End Frameworks.

Updates to this project may come later.
